### What is Rostering?

Rostering is a feature on Remind that allows schools & districts to import data from their School Information System (SIS) into the Remind platform. This data typically includes information about their students, parents, teachers, classes, and schools. Remind offers several rostering types, including CSV file based and API based integrations.

### Scenario

 A district has uploaded a set of CSV files to Remind to use rostering to import their data. However after the import was completed they found that one of their classes and one of their users were not imported. There are some problems with the data in their CSV files that we'll need to locate and fix. This district is using the CSV 1.0 Roster Type, and those specifications are located on our help center.

### Challenge 1

The customer is reporting that not all classes were created. Specifically, class_18 has an error that says it wasn't created. Why wasn't this class created?

### Challenge 2

The customer successfully uploaded their CSVs after fixing the problems found in challenge 1. But unfortunately what was created is still not correct. The customer is reporting that not all enrollments were created. Specifically, student_309 is not being enrolled in class_39. Why are they not being added?
